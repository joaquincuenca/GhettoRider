GhettoRider is an Android application built in Kotlin, designed as a learning and portfolio project where I explore mobile development fundamentals, UI creation, and app architecture using modern Android tools and best practices. The project serves as a foundation for experimenting with features, improving my skills in Kotlin, and building a functional mobile app from scratch. As the app evolves, it will include improved UI components, interactive features, and a more refined user experience.
